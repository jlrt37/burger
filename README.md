#burger
Application allows user to enter any burger name and add it to the menu. This adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user can "eat" any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent side and updates its status in the database.

Currently the app is not launching properly.
